# tau_detection

A repository for all the code used in my Part II Project.

A small subset of training data taken from one cortical slide,
for quick training runs and other tests, in `./small_training`.

Groovy scripts used to export data from QuPath projects in `./qupath_scripts`.
Note that the scripts shouldn't be used as isâ€” commented lines with
placeholders (e.g. /PLACEHOLDER/) should be uncommented with a value
substituted as desired.
